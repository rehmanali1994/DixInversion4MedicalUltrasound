Sound Speed Estimator for Layered Media in Medical Ultrasound Imaging. 

Medical ultrasound imaging typically assumes a constant sound speed of 1540 m/s in the medium. However, sound speed is known to vary by tissue type (e.g. muscle, connective tissues, fat). The reconstruction of sound speed in the human body using backscattered ultrasound signals is often regarded as inverse problem. 

We provide sample data and algorithms presented in

for the reconstruction of sound speed in heterogeneous and diffuse-scattering medium when sound speed varies as a function of depth into the medium. 

If you use the code/algorithm for research, please cite the above paper.
